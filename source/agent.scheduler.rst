Agent scheduler
***************

The OpenSVC agent embeds a scheduler. The node and each service has a private schedule.

Scheduler behaviour
===================

The agent postinstall configures a system's scheduler job at a 1 minute period executing the ``nodemgr schedulers`` command. This ``schedulers`` action runs the OpenSVC agent scheduler for the node and each service.

For each task, the scheduler determines if the current time meets the task's schedule definition constraints. If all constraints are met, the task action is run in a subprocess and the last run timestamp is updated.

The schedule definition constraints are expressed as allowed timeranges and minimum period. Example: In ``00:00-02:00@120``, the timerange is from midnight to 2am, the period is 120 minuntes. Multiple ``<timerange>@<period>`` can be defined with the syntax ``["00:00-02:00@120", "12:00-14:00@120"]``

If an allowed timerange is longer than the system's schedule period, multiple consecutive scheduler run will meet the schedule *timerange* constraint. If the *period* is also met (the task has not run in the last <period> minutes), the scheduler rolls a dice and decides if the task is run now, or delayed to a next scheduler run. The probability of deciding to run augments linearly with the current time position in the timerange. For example, with a ``00:00-02:00`` timerange, at midnight the probability is around 10%. At 01:50 the probabilty is 100%.

This behaviour spreads the tasks execution on all nodes over the whole timerange length. As most tasks, induce communications with the collector, the collector load is leveled. 

Any task (except sync tasks) execution in its subprocess is delayed by a random few seconds to level collector load spikes caused by time-synchronized nodes actions being validated at the same time. For example, on a 1000 agent population with pushasset schedule set to ``00:00-02:00@120``, ~90 agents will execute the action at 00:00. The random delay ensures the collector won't receive all 90 data payloads at the same second.

Node schedule

::

	$ sudo nodemgr print schedule
	action                last run               config parameter          schedule definition
	------                --------               ----------------          -------------------
	auto_reboot           2016-02-23 16:50:01    reboot.schedule           16:00-17:00@1 sat:last,tue-mon:last * %2+1,feb-apr
	auto_rotate_root_pw   2015-02-25 17:17:17    rotate_root_pw.schedule   -
	...

The scheduled tasks can be configured in ``<OSVCETC>/node.conf`` with a configlet like::

	[<section>]
	<parameter> = <definition>

The 'config parameter' column in the ``print schedule``  output is formatted as::

	<section>.<parameter>

And the current definition, explicit or implicit is visible in the 'schedule definition' column. A dash character means never scheduled.

The ``nodemgr`` command executed when the schedule constraints are met is displayed in the 'action' column.

The supported schedules are:

* Node inventoring tasks : pushasset, pushpatch, pushpkg, pushdisks
* Node performance metrics inventoring : pushstats
* Node performance metrics collection : collect_stats
* Node file content tracking task : sysreport
* Node configuration audit and/or remediation task : compliance_auto
* Health checking task : checks
* Scheduled node reboot task : auto_reboot
* Scheduled root password rotation task : auto_rotate_root_pw
* Execution of nodemgr actions queued by the collector : dequeue_actions
* SAN switches inventoring tasks : pushbrocade
* Storage arrays inventoring tasks : pushcentera, pushdcs, pushemcvnx, pusheva, pushfreenas, pushhds, pushhp3par, pushibmds, pushibmsvc, pushnecism, pushnetapp, pushsym, pushvioserver
* Backup servers saves index inventoring tasks : pushnsr

The scheduled tasks can be configured in ``<OSVCETC>/<svcname>.env`` with a configlet like::

	[<section>]
	<parameter> = <definition>

The 'config parameter' column in the ``print schedule``  output is formatted as::

	<section>.<parameter>

And the current definition, explicit or implicit is visible in the 'schedule definition' column. A dash character means never scheduled.

The ``svcmgr -s <svcname>`` command executed when the schedule constraints are met is displayed in the 'action' column.

The supported schedules are:

* Service configuration audit and/or remediation task : compliance_auto
* Service configuration inventoring task : push_env
* Service status inventoring task : push_service_status
* Service sync resources actions : sync_all

Schedule testing
================

Executing the scheduler code file triggers a test routine.

::

	$ python <OSVCLIB>/rcScheduler.py
	passed : test '2015-02-27 10:00' in schedule ''       expected False => result False (no schedule)
	passed : test '2015-02-27 10:00' in schedule '@0'     expected False => result False (interval set to 0)
	passed : test '2015-02-27 10:00' in schedule '*@0'    expected False => result False (interval set to 0)
	passed : test '2015-02-27 10:00' in schedule '*'      expected True => result True 
	passed : test '2015-02-27 10:00' in schedule '*@61'   expected True => result True 
	...

You can add your own test in the ``tests`` structure at the end of this file.
