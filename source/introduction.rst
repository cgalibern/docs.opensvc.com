What is OpenSVC
---------------

OpenSVC is a software product and the name of the commercial entity developping, supporting and marketing it. The product will be referenced as "OpenSVC" and the company "OpenSVC co". This book covers extensively the OpenSVC goals, design and usage.

OpenSVC is composed of two software components:

* the collector
* the agent

The two components together address a wide range of IT issue including business continuity, application availability, continuous audit, alarming, performance analysis, asset management, software and hardware lifecycle management, trending, resource accounting, storage management, provisioning and compliance. OpenSVC is operating system, application and hardware agnostic.

The OpenSVC agent is basically a Cluster Resource Manager with extended reporting capabilities. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. The collector is a proprietary web 2.0 application aggregating the agents data. The Resource Management features of the agent are fully functional in the absence of a collector. Coupled by a heartbeat software, the agent completes a full cluster stack.
