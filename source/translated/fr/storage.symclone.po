"EMC Symmetrix arrays clones allow multi-target block device replication, "
"splitting a set of cloned devices, resyncing and merging changes on a clone "
"set to its source set. After the initial full copy, all resyncs are delta-"
"based. These excellent features allow opensvc to drive services using a "
"cloned device set, handling the splitting on start-up and providing a simple "
"command for resync and merge-back. This kind of services are often used for "
"maintenance, pre-production, performance testing environments, where the "
"source device set is used for production. The following documentation "
"presents the configuration of such a service."
